          <h2>Welcome to Mountain View CA Caviar Buying Club</h2>

<div>This is a small site for local caviar buying club located in Mountain View</div>
<div>The idea is very simple - you can order a caviar/fish/seafood directly from fishermen - see more info <a href="http://www.lummiislandwild.com/" target="_blank">here </a></div>
<div>Buying club news and other information are usually posted on this site home page</div>
<div>If you want to join the club you have to join this mailing group <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mountainviewsalmoncoop">https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mountainviewsalmoncoop</a></div>
<div>This way you will be notified about new orders. Also you can use it for splitting orders if you want as they might be too big for some.</div>
<div>Usually you have to order up to a month in advance. After all orders are closed it took up to 2 weeks for delivery. The fish and caviar will arrive deep frozen and you are responsible for picking it up as soon as possible after delivery. No frozen storage is available at the drop location, so please check your email often on the delivery day. The fishers recommend bringing a cooler with ice for your caviar so it does not thaw.</div>
<div>Usually there is group discount which applies during checkout.</div>
